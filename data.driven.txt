Fortunately, behind the rapid changes in technology, there are enduring principles
that remain true, no matter which version of a particular tool you are using. If you
understand those principles, you’re in a position to see where each tool fits in, how to
make good use of it, and how to avoid its pitfalls.

Reliability
The system should continue to work correctly (performing the correct function at
the desired level of performance) even in the face of adversity (hardware or soft‐
ware faults, and even human error)

The things that can go wrong are called faults, and systems that anticipate faults and
can cope with them are called fault-tolerant or resilient.

Note that a fault is not the same as a failure [2]. A fault is usually defined as one com‐
ponent of the system deviating from its spec, whereas a failure is when the system as a
whole stops providing the required service to the user.

Scalability
As the system grows (in data volume, traffic volume, or complexity), there should
be reasonable ways of dealing with that growth.

Scalability is the term we use to describe a system’s ability to cope with increased
load.

Maintainability
Over time, many different people will work on the system (engineering and oper‐
ations, both maintaining current behavior and adapting the system to new use
cases), and they should all be able to work on it productively.


Latency and response time are often used synonymously, but they
are not the same. The response time is what the client sees: besides
the actual time to process the request (the service time), it includes
network delays and queueing delays. Latency is the duration that a
request is waiting to be handled—during which it is latent, await‐
ing service [ 17 ].

It’s common to see the average response time of a service reported. (Strictly speaking,
the term “average” doesn’t refer to any particular formula, but in practice it is usually
understood as the arithmetic mean: given n values, add up all the values, and divide
by n.) However, the mean is not a very good metric if you want to know your “typi‐
cal” response time, because it doesn’t tell you how many users actually experienced
that delay.
Usually it is better to use percentiles. If you take your list of response times and sort it
from fastest to slowest, then the median is the halfway point: for example, if your
median response time is 200 ms, that means half your requests return in less than
200 ms, and half your requests take longer than that.

Even if only a small percentage of backend calls are slow, the
chance of getting a slow call increases if an end-user request requires multiple back‐
end calls, and so a higher proportion of end-user requests end up being slow (an
effect known as tail latency amplification [ 24 ]).

People often talk of a dichotomy between scaling up (vertical scaling, moving to a
more powerful machine) and scaling out (horizontal scaling, distributing the load
across multiple smaller machines). Distributing load across multiple machines is also
known as a shared-nothing architecture.

In an early-stage startup or an unpro‐
ven product it’s usually more important to be able to iterate quickly on product fea‐
tures than it is to scale to some hypothetical future load.

Even though they are specific to a particular application, scalable architectures are
nevertheless usually built from general-purpose building blocks, arranged in familiar
patterns.

Yet, unfortunately, many people working on software systems dislike maintenance of
so-called legacy systems—perhaps it involves fixing other people’s mistakes, or work‐
ing with platforms that are now outdated, or systems that were forced to do things
they were never intended for. Every legacy system is unpleasant in its own way, and
so it is difficult to give general recommendations for dealing with them.

However, we can and should design software in such a way that it will hopefully min‐
imize pain during maintenance, and thus avoid creating legacy software ourselves. To
this end, we will pay particular attention to three design principles for software
systems:
Operability
Make it easy for operations teams to keep the system running smoothly.
Simplicity
Make it easy for new engineers to understand the system, by removing as much
complexity as possible from the system. (Note this is not the same as simplicity
of the user interface.)
Evolvability
Make it easy for engineers to make changes to the system in the future, adapting
it for unanticipated use cases as requirements change. Also known as extensibil‐
ity, modifiability, or plasticity.

Small software projects can have delightfully simple and expressive code, but as
projects get larger, they often become very complex and difficult to understand. This
complexity slows down everyone who needs to work on the system, further increas‐
ing the cost of maintenance. A software project mired in complexity is sometimes
described as a big ball of mud [30]

Making a system simpler does not necessarily mean reducing its functionality; it can
also mean removing accidental complexity. Moseley and Marks [32] define complex‐
ity as accidental if it is not inherent in the problem that the software solves (as seen
by the users) but arises only from the implementation.

CHAPTER 2 DATA MODELS ANDS QUERIES

There are many different kinds of data models, and every data model embodies
assumptions about how it is going to be used. Some kinds of usage are easy and some
are not supported; some operations are fast and some perform badly; some data
transformations feel natural and some are awkward.

There are several driving forces behind the adoption of NoSQL databases, including:
• A need for greater scalability than relational databases can easily achieve, includ‐
ing very large datasets or very high write throughput
• A widespread preference for free and open source software over commercial
database products
• Specialized query operations that are not well supported by the relational model
• Frustration with the restrictiveness of relational schemas, and a desire for a more
dynamic and expressive data model [5]

If the database itself does not support joins, you have to emulate a join in application
code by making multiple queries to the database.
The work of making the join is shifted from the database to the application code.
Even if the initial version of an application fits well in a join-free docu‐
ment model, data has a tendency of becoming more interconnected as features are
added to applications.

The CODASYL model was a generalization of the hierarchical model. In the tree
structure of the hierarchical model, every record has exactly one parent; in the net‐
work model, a record could have multiple parents. For example, there could be one
record for the "Greater Seattle Area" region, and every user who lived in that
region could be linked to it. This allowed many-to-one and many-to-many relation‐
ships to be modeled.

The main arguments in favor of the document data model are schema flexibility, bet‐
ter performance due to locality, and that for some applications it is closer to the data
structures used by the application. The relational model counters by providing better
support for joins, and many-to-one and many-to-many relationships.

Document databases are sometimes called schemaless, but that’s misleading, as the
code that reads the data usually assumes some kind of structure—i.e., there is an
implicit schema, but it is not enforced by the database [20]
